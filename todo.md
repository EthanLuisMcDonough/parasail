## TODO

- WIP readme (readme.md)
- WIP dev guide (parasail-dev-guide.md)
- github actions (build interp, compiler, examples -> notif when something is broken)
- @sttaft : compose compact, expressive, fully packed example snippet --> top of readme.md
- discussion about repo clean up / split -> (parasail, ada2x, parython etc)
- create releases from github actions --> release github page (interp, compiler with install script for platform (linux, win) + ?what?)
- ref manual says 8.0. We are at ... ~ 9.3 (What should be done about it?)
- dig more on that : https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-an-extension-to-a-language
