How to build sal_annotator :

cd tools_paging/java_parser 
../utils/GNAT/build.sh sal_annotator.exe

sal_annotator will be built in /home/build/ada/user/tools_paging/GNAT
(e.g. in same place where inspector.exe gets built).
Note: You would need aflex and ayacc to build sal_annoator.
To build aflex and ayacc do the following
cd tools_paging/aflex_ayacc
../utils/GNAT/build.sh test
The aflex and ayacc would be built in ../bld/GNAT.
Copy aflex.exe and ayacc.exe to wherever you want
to invoke from. The regular version is in
/opt/sofcheck/adamaigc/bin directory.
The aflex and ayacc don't need to be built daily.

How to run :
First run the inspector in the regular way
e.g. inspector -all -lib switch_test.library ...

Then run the sal_annotator as follows:
sal_annotator switch_test.output

The listing file for the SAL annotations will be in
switch_test.output/list directory and will be named as
switch_test.java.sal.txt. For each source file, there will be
a listing file with SAL annotations.

There are a couple of simple tests in java2il/salannotator_tests.
cd java2il/salannotator_tests
Run inspector -all -lib testref.library
Then run sal_annotator testref.output
The sal listings will be in list testref.output/list directory.
